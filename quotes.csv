Believe you can and you're halfway there.
Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment.
Push yourself, because no one else is going to do it for you.
Success doesn't come from what you do occasionally, it comes from what you do consistently.
Do something today that your future self will thank you for.
Great things never come from comfort zones.
Stay focused and never give up.
Wake up with determination. Go to bed with satisfaction.
Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.
It always seems impossible until it's done.
